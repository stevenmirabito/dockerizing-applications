						### What is a container?

						* Encapsulates discrete components of applications provisioned only with the minimal resources needed to do their job. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
						* Has its own process space, its own network interfaces, can run stuff as root, and can even have its own init system. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
							* Can run an Ubuntu-based container and install packages with apt on a CentOS host, or vice versa. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
						* Processes and networking are isolated from the host, but share the kernel. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
						* Basically, a chroot on steroids. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

						### Why should I care?

						* Build once, push to registry, then run with one command: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
							```bash
							docker run -p 8080:8080 computersciencehouse/conditional
							```
						* Eliminates needing to install dependencies/packages/etc. on the host <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
						* Each app runs isolated from each other, so you can use easily run different versions of software and languages <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
						* Automate testing and deployment <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
						* Reduce compatibility problems across platforms <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
						* Very little overhead compared to a VM <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

						### Getting Started

						1. Install the Docker Engine from https://docker.com
							* Supports Linux, Mac, and Windows
						2. Open a terminal/command prompt
						3. Run your first container:
						```bash
						docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world'
						```
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						### So what just happened?

						```bash
						docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world'
						```

						* `docker run` runs a container.
						* `ubuntu` is the image you want to run, in this case the Ubuntu operating system.
						* `/bin/echo` is the command you want to run inside the container.
							* Containers can specify a default command to run, which we'll see shortly.

					### Some Docker Engine Commands

					* `docker build` - Build an image from a Dockerfile
					* `docker exec` - Run a command inside a running container
					* `docker images` - List local Docker images
					* `docker ps` - List running containers
					* `docker rm` - Delete a container
					* `docker rmi` - Delete a local image
					* `docker run` - Run a container
					* `docker stop` - Stop a running container

					... and many more. Run `docker help` to see them all.

                        ### Your First Containerized App

                        Start a new interactive (`-i`) CentOS 7 container with a TTY (`-t`):

                        ```bash
                        docker run -it centos:7 /bin/bash
                        ```

                        If you have the image locally, the container will start immediately. Otherwise, it will take a few minutes to download it from the Docker Hub.

                        Once the container starts, you'll get a Bash prompt within the container:

                        ```bash
                        [root@8431f1550cc0 /]#
                        ```
                    </script>

                    <script type="text/template">
                        ### Your First Containerized App

                        Let's go ahead and install Flask for our example app:

                        ```bash
                        [root@8431f1550cc0 /]# yum install python-flask
                        [root@8431f1550cc0 /]# yum clean all
                        ```

                        Note that we're deleting the yum cache - this will reduce the final image size.

                        Next, let's make a quick Flask app:

                        ```bash
                        [root@8431f1550cc0 /]# curl -fsSL https://goo.gl/K8b4y9 > hello.py
                        ```

                        Note that we're exposing the service to the world and running it on port 8080.  This will allow us to access the service from the host network.

                        Finally, exit out of the container:

                        ```bash
                        [root@8431f1550cc0 /]# exit
                        ```
                    </script>
                </section>

                <section data-markdown>
                    <script type="text/template">
                        ### Your First Containerized App

                        Now that our container is set up, we need to commit it to a new image:

                        ```bash
                        docker commit 8431f1550cc0 seminar/hello:latest
                        ```

                        * `docker commit` tells the Docker Engine we want to save our container
                        * `8431f1550cc0` is the container ID, which is the hostname as seen in the container's Bash prompt
                        * `seminar/hello:latest` is the image name, in three parts:
                          * `seminar` is the _namespace_, which is usually your Docker Hub username
                          * `hello` is the _image name_, which is usually your Docker Hub repository
                          * `latest` is the _image tag_, which is arbitrary but `latest` is usually used to denote the newest image
                    </script>
                </section>

                <section data-markdown>
                    <script type="text/template">
                        ### Your First Containerized App

                        Now we can run our app:

                        ```
                        docker run -p 8080:8080 seminar/hello:latest /usr/bin/python hello.py
                        ```

                        Note that we're using a new flag here: `-p 8080:8080` indicates that we want to forward port 8080 from the container to the host network

                        If all went well, you should see:

                        ```
                         * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/
                        ```

                        And if you go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser...

                        Now that we know how to manually containerize an app, let's take a look at how we can automate that process and version control the instructions.

                        The way we do that with Docker is with a _Dockerfile_.

                        Some Dockerfile instructions:

                        * `FROM` - The base image to build on top of
                        * `MAINTAINER` - The maintainer of the image
                        * `RUN` - Run a command in the container
                        * `EXPOSE` - Expose a port to the host network
                        * `ENV` - Set an environment variable in the container
                        * `COPY` - Copy files into the container
                        * `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` - Default executable for the image
                    </script>

                        Now, build the image:

                        ```bash
                        docker build -t seminar/hello:latest .
                        ```

                        * `docker build` tells the Docker Engine that we want to build an image
                        * `-t seminar/hello:latest` says we want to name and tag the image
                        * `.` says we want to set the build context to the current directory

                        And run it again (note that we no longer have to specify the command):

                        ```bash
                        docker run -p 8080:8080 seminar/hello:latest
                        ```

                        The Dockerfile can be kept in a VCS repository and versioned along with your code. It can also be used to run automated builds on the Docker Hub.

                        ### Writing a Dockerfile

                        Best Practices

                        * **Containers should be ephemeral** - Your container should be able to be stopped, destroyed, and rebuilt with little to no configuration required. This allows for seamless application updates. Most applications achieve this by using environment variable-driven configuration.
                        * **Use the cache** - The Docker Engine will automatically cache each step of your build as "layers" that sit on top of one another, so put build steps that take a while (installing packages, etc.) near the top of your Dockerfile. Subsequent builds as you tweak your Dockerfile will take much less time.

                        ### Writing a Dockerfile

                        Best Practices

                        * **Use a small base image** - Investigate smaller base images such as Alpine Linux instead of using a CentOS or Ubuntu base. This one step can reduce the size of your image by hundreds of megabytes.
                        * **Only install what you need** - Images can quickly balloon to a massive size. Only install the packages and dependencies you need to run your application.
                        * **Minimize the number of layers** - Find a balance between Dockerfile readability and the number of layers you create (e.g. combine `RUN` commands wherever possible).

                        ### Writing a Dockerfile

                        Best Practices

                        * **Run only one process per container** - Decoupling applications into multiple containers makes it easy to scale your application overall and makes updates easier. Containers can be linked and use internal networking to talk to each other.
                        * **Use a .dockerignore** - Similar to a `.gitignore`, this file tells the Docker Engine about files it can safely exclude from the build context to reduce the size of the image.
                        * **Sort multi-line arguments** - If you're installing a list of packages, sort them alphabetically.

                        ### Registries

                        Docker images can be pulled from and pushed to a Docker _registry_, which makes it easy to deploy your images. You can host your own registry, or use one of a number of public registries such as:

                        * Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com
                        * CoreOS Quay - https://quay.io

                        These cloud registries also allow you to do automated builds with GitHub and generic webhooks, allowing you to further automate your container builds.

                        ### Registries

                        To log into the Docker Hub, run:

                        ```bash
                        docker login
                        ```

                        To push an image from your local machine up to the Docker Hub, run:

                        ```bash
                        docker push computersciencehouse/seminar-hello:latest
                        ```

                        To pull an image (without running it), run:

                        ```bash
                        docker pull computersciencehouse/seminar-hello:latest
                        ```

                        As mentioned before, images that aren't present locally will be automatically pulled when run.
